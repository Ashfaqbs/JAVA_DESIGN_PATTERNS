# JAVA_DESIGN_PATTERNS

## Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems. They are time-tested approaches that have been proven to work effectively in different scenarios, and they can help developers avoid common pitfalls and make better design decisions.

There are many different design patterns, but some of the most famous and widely used ones include:

Creational Patterns: Singleton, Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder, and Prototype.
Structural Patterns: Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, and Proxy.
Behavioral Patterns: Observer, Strategy, Command, Chain of Responsibility, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, State, Template Method, and Visitor.


Each of these patterns provides a different way to solve a specific type of problem, and they can be combined together to create more complex solutions. It's important to note that design patterns are not a silver bullet, and they should be used judiciously to solve specific problems, rather than applied blindly to every situation.
