# Java Design Patterns

## Java Design Patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems. They provide a way to solve problems related to object-oriented programming in a consistent and efficient way. Here are some popular Java Design Patterns:

Singleton: Ensures that only one instance of a class is created and provides a global point of access to it.

Factory: Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

Adapter: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping one class with another that has a compatible interface.

Observer: Allows an object to be notified when the state of another object changes.

Decorator: Dynamically adds behaviors to an object without modifying its original class.

Strategy: Allows algorithms to be selected at runtime based on specific client needs.

Template Method: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a superclass, but allows subclasses to override specific steps in the algorithm.

Command: Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing you to parameterize clients with different requests.

State: Allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes.

Facade: Provides a simplified interface to a complex system of classes.

## Types:
### Creational Design patterns
### Structural Desgin pattern
### Behavior Deisgn pattern

These are just a few examples of the many design patterns that can be used in Java programming. Using design patterns can improve the efficiency, scalability, and maintainability of your code.
